## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to security@hosted.ai
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes (optional)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of your report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 1 week
  - Medium: 2 weeks
  - Low: Next release cycle

### Responsible Disclosure

- Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we've had a chance to address it
- We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We do not pursue legal action against researchers who follow responsible disclosure

## Security-Related Environment Variables

The following environment variables are critical for security. See `.env.example` for the full list.

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` | Secret for signing admin JWT tokens |
| `CUSTOMER_JWT_SECRET` | Secret for signing customer JWT tokens |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe API key - never expose to client |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Validates incoming Stripe webhooks |
| `HOSTEDAI_API_KEY` | hosted.ai API authentication |
| `EMAILIT_API_KEY` | Email service authentication |

### Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets**: All secrets should be in `.env.local` (gitignored)
2. **Rotate keys regularly**: Especially after team member departures
3. **Use environment-specific keys**: Different keys for dev/staging/production
4. **Limit access**: Only grant production access to those who need it
5. **Use Platform Settings**: Sensitive keys stored in the database are encrypted with AES-256-GCM

## Security Features

### Authentication

- **JWT-based**: Stateless authentication with signed tokens
- **Token Expiry**: Customer tokens expire in 24h, admin sessions in 1h
- **Two-Factor Auth**: TOTP-based 2FA for admin accounts
- **Magic Links**: Passwordless login reduces credential theft risk

### Authorization

- **Role-based**: Separate customer, admin, and investor roles
- **Stripe Integration**: Customer identity tied to Stripe customer ID
- **Team Isolation**: Data scoped to hosted.ai teams

### Data Protection

- **Encrypted Settings**: Sensitive platform settings encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **No PII in Logs**: Sensitive data redacted from console output
- **HTTPS Only**: All production traffic encrypted

### Input Validation

- **API Validation**: Request bodies validated before processing
- **SQL Injection**: Prisma ORM prevents injection attacks
- **XSS Prevention**: React's default escaping + manual HTML sanitization
